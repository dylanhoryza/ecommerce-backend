# ecommerce-backend
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to build an ecommerce backend database using REST APIs, Sequelize, and Express.js.
- I built this application to better understand how API routes work with databases.
- This application solves the problem of having an ecommerce database that can create new products and categories and have them saved in
the correct API routes.
- I learned how to create databases using Sequelize, use routes to create, update, and delete products or categories, and how to use Insomnia to test 
all of your API routes.

## Installation
To install this application, you can test the routes in your browser or another application like Insomnia.
## Usage
To use this project, go to http://localhost:3001/api/ and add the parameters categories, products, or tags to be able to create, read, update, or delete
data from the databases. The following video demonstrates how this is done.
